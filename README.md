The main objective of this is to provide indoor navigation. the problem faced during the boarding or using other facilities by airport most people are unaware of where that counter is and whom to ask about is, or where to go.
So we can solve this problem with our project name really lose. We are going to implement this on unity so that we can give the virtual reality experience to our users. So the app will look like a 3D model and help to navigate from one place to another.
This idea can be extended to other places also big malls and big retails shop etc.
